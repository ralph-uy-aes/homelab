TryHackMe Notes 📝

THM is great for learning the fundamentals and theory. Labs are simulated via both VMs and site simulations. The guides are extremely comprehensive and the material is great. However, the labs are lackluster and often seem to be spoon-feeding you the solutions. There is a pro version which seems very interesting to me.

I will keep my notes in this part of the repo...
