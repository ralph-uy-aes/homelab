# Lab 3: Footprinting a Website

#### Overview
- In this exercise, you’ll map a website using Maltego. To do so, you will need to register for a free Maltego account. The following instructions assume you’re creating a new account using a student email address; alternatively, the instructor can create accounts for students before class.

#### Maltego
- Penetration testing tool with more features than HackSearch Pro
- Privacy Mode
    - Normal
        - Fetches data directly form the internet
        - Makes very little direct contact with examined internet sites
    - Stealth Privacy
        - Use when secrecy is essential
        - No internet traffic originates from your IP
        - Maltego does not fetch data directly from the internet, instead downloads entities
- Machines
    - Automated scripts that allow you to find domains and such, much like HackSearch Pro
    - One of the easiest ways to use Maltego
    - Three levels of intensity
- Installing Transforms
    - Transforms should be pre-installed, but for me they weren't
    - I had to install Utilities from the Transform Hub to get the standard transforms
