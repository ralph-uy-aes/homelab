# Chapter 3: Risk Management - Module A: Social Engineering

#### About Social Engineering
- The most bulletproof technical solutions can all be undone by unsecure human practices
- Social engineering attacks take advantage of human behaviors
    - One of the biggest and most overlooked source of security threats
- Impersonation is a common factor in social engineering
    - Pretend to be a coworker, technical support, banker, boss, relative

#### Social Engineering Effectivity
- Manipulate users by exploiting human emotional traits
- Authority: Attackers try to project authority by imitating a government agency or corporate VIP
- Intimidation: Some attacks attempt to scare victims into compliance
- Consensus: People are more likely to be taken in by a scam if it seems that other people think it's legitimate
- Scarcity: Attacker plays on the user's fear of missing out, pushing them to make a rash decision
- Familiarity: Plays on familiarity and making people put their guard down
- Trust: Some people are just very trusting
- Urgency: Attacker creates a sense of urgency, pressuring compliance of users without thinking things through

#### Pretexting
- Art of designing a fictional scenario or pretext
- Making a cover story and make victim believe everything the attacker is saying

#### Eliciting Information
- Luring the subject into believing that a casual conversation is not an attempt to gather secret information
- Making an interrogation seem like a conversation
- Successful elicitation tends to be flattering and encouraging with many open-ended questions

#### Social Engineering Attacks
- Partial list of goals:
    - Reconnaissance attacks: Gather sensitive data as primary goal or to set up more attacks
    - Financial fraud: Financial gain
    - Credential harvesting: Gain access to secure systems
    - Trojan horse: Spread malware through an outwardly innocent vector
    - Influence campaigns: Shape people's opinions about some topic
    - Physical access to restricted areas: Bypass locked entries or ID checks

#### Phishing
- Attacker casts out a bait in the form of seemingly legitimate messages
- Whoever responds is on the hook for social engineering attacks
    - Could attach viruses in emails
    - Could send you a link to infect your browser or steal login info

#### Goals of Phishing
- Communication: Build rapport with victims to convince them to make rash decisions
- Malicious attachment: Messages with attached malware infect target systems
- Malicious link: Messages with links that could have malicious scripts or impersonate legitimate websites to steal credentials
- Prepending: Prepended code with malicious scripts might bypass browser security features
- Credential harvesting: Messages with links designed to steal user information
- Drive-by malware: Messages with links that download and install malware
- Invoice scam: Messages with fake bills or invoices that demand payments

#### Phishing Variants
- Vishing: Voice phishing makes use of voice calls to impersonate people
- Smishing: SMS Phishing makes use of SMS or some text message protocol
- Spear Phishing: Tailored content to a specific person or group, more targeted that phishing
- Whaling: Even more targeted to high-profile and high-value targets
- Business Email Compromise (BEC): Form of spear phishing where attacker targets a specific business by impersonating personnel, uses lookalike email domains

#### Brand Impersonation
- Core part of BEC
- Many forms:
    - A vendor who wants to correct a billing issue or offer a special deal
    - A technical support specialist following up on some reported problem
    - A security organization or law enforcement agency warning about a threat requiring urgent action
    - A recruiter offering a job
    - A customer support specialist contacting you about a product you complained about

#### Typosquatting
- AKA URL Hijacking
- Mistyping a website name in order to make it seem like a legitimate website
- Visiting a hijacked URL takes you to the malicious site
- Hard to fight back against unless the domain name or site contents infringe on trademarks
    - No legal recourse
- Clickjacking is similar by hiding clickable content under seemingly ordinary content elements

#### Watering Hole Attacks
- Closely related to brand impersonation
- Two-stage attack exploiting trust
- Attacker identifies a vulnerable website or service
- Compromise the site to infect visitors with malware
- If you can compromise sites that enterprises rely on, you can probably compromise the enterprise as well

#### Spam and Misinformation
- Unsolicited messages that can transmit malware or attempt phishing
- Misinformation is spread by someone who incorrectly believes for it to be true
- Disinformation is a deliberate lie

#### Influence Campaigns
- Target social groups or entire societies to influence them
- Use impersonation and disinformation over broadcast messages
- Influencing party might spread information directly, via bot accounts, or by targeting influential people who can spread the message for them
- Clever ones even use deep fake technologies

#### Physical Intrusion by Social Engineering
- Shoulder surfing
    - Watching someone who is viewing or entering sensitive information
    - Eavesdropping on confidential conversations
    - Dangerous for employees doing work-related communications in public places
- Tailgating or Piggybacking
    - Getting into a secure area by tagging along right behind someone with legitimate access, with or without their knowledge
    - May have different forms, but involve trickery and a play on carelessness
- Dumpster diving
    - Digging in the target's trash to hunt for discarded documents and other media
    - Routine documents like schedules, policy manuals, contact lists, and personal information are less likely to be securely disposed of
