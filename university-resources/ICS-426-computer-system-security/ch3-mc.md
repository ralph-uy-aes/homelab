# Chapter 3: Organizational Security - Module C: User Roles and Training

#### Role-based Training
- Offer custom-tailored training programs to classes of users based on their workplace duties
- End Users: Anyone who needs to know about common threats and how to protect against them
- Customer-facing Employees: Employees who deal with customers need additional focus on recognizing social engineering attacks and protecting PR
- Privileged Users: Train privileged users of their responsibilities with their elevated permissions and importance of not sharing credentials
- Administrators: Need to know about technical threats facing networks and systems and how to configure and maintain security solutions
- Incident Response Teams: Need detailed procedures related to their duties, security guards and physical threats, workstation troubleshooters and malware training and incident response and forensics
- Management: Executives need to have a high-level understanding of security, don't need to know all the details

#### Security Awareness Guidelines
- Social Engineering
    - Train employees to recognize and respond to common social engineering attacks
    - Encourage a culture of caution and verification to prevent risky actions by personnel
    - Provide regular testing and examples of social engineering scenarios
- Insider Threats
    - Educate employees about the risk of insider threats and why they shouldn't trust someone implicitly
    - Implement access controls based on principles like need-to-know, separation of duties, and due control
    - Encourage peer-review of work to check for unusual activity
- Password Management
    - Train employees on creating strong passwords
    - Ensure that passwords are kept secret and are not shared between users, written down, or transmitted over insecure channels
    - Encourage adoption of technologies to avoid password vulnerabilities such as MFA or password managers
- Removable media and cables
    - Educate employees about risks associated with untrusted removable media or cables
    - Discourage use of personal removable media and external devices on company systems
    - Train employees to identify signs of cable tampering or authorized external devices
- Hybrid/Remote work environments
    - Educate employees of risks associated with remote work such as unsecured public WiFi, should surfing, and home computer risks
    - Develop policies for remote work such as the use of trusted VPNs and devices
    - Check in regularly with remote workers to verify compliance
- Reporting
    - Foster a culture of reporting, if you see something say something
    - Create easy-to-use reporting mechanisms and ensure employees know where to find them
    - Take reports seriously

#### Designing Training Programs
- Computer-based Training (CBT): Students take courses from their workstations, progress is tracked through a learning management system
- Gamification: Applying game design to training, makes training fun
- Capture the Flag (CTF): Common gamification technique for hacking and cybersecurity

#### Monitoring Security Awareness
1. Define program's goals in plain language and in quantifiable KPIs
2. Perform initial testing to establish a baseline for security performance
3. Monitor performance to look for change
4. Analyze the collected data to generate a report on the program's progress
5. Review results and use them as feedback to improve awareness program
