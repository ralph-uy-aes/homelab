#### Shodan
- Title: Shodan

- URL: https://www.shodan.io

- Abstract: Shodan is essentially a search engine for any device connected to the internet. Everything from open cameras, routers, servers, mobile devices, etc... can be looked up. This tool is particularly useful for reconnaissance which is first stage of the cyber kill chain. According to Wikipedia, it gathers data from HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, SSH, Telnet, SNMP, IMAP, SMTP, SIP, and RTSP. RTSP is port 554 which is used for camera devices.

- Why it is useful for professionals: Shodan can streamline the process of reconnaissance for many cybersecurity professionals. I actually remember using it back when I was around 13 years old to search for cameras from all over the world. I was able to login to these IP cameras using default credentials like admin/admin or admin/password and I saw a large variety of things like inside people's houses, secure facilities, street cameras, etc... Nowadays, these IP cameras aren't as unsecure so there was barely any left on Shodan last I checked. I believe that this experience stresses the need for everyone to avoid using default credentials. Shodan streamlined the process of finding IP cameras for me which allowed me to do some reconnaissance, albeit for no meaningful purpose whatsoever.
