#### MITRE ATT&CK
- Title: MITRE ATT&CK

- URL: https://attack.mitre.org

- Abstract: According to the website, "MITRE ATT&CK is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. The ATT&CK knowledge base is used as a foundation for the development of specific threat models and methodologies in the private sector, in government, and in the cybersecurity product and service community." In one sentence, MITRE ATT&CK is a free knowledge base that anyone can use as reference for their cybersecurity solutions.

- Why it is useful for professionals: It is regularly updated in order to keep track of the constantly evolving cybersecurity landscape. By keeping track of new exploits and threats and giving free access to the reports, MITRE ATT&CK proves its worth and is often used by the government and cybersecurity professionals. Furthermore, it reminds us to keep track of our threat analysis as cybersecurity students and professionals. Making formal reports about incidents and threats is extremely crucial to becoming an effective cybersecurity professional. On the other hand, the MITRE ATT&CK framework could be used by penetration testing professionals to make their own exploits.

- Abstract: The SANS Internet Storm Center (ISC) is a program by the SANS Institute that monitors malicious internet activity and provides daily threat analysis. It collects data from a global network of sensors and offers insights into emerging threats, vulnerabilities, and attack patterns. The ISC publishes daily diaries written by cybersecurity professionals, sharing real-time information and expert analysis.

- Why it's useful: The ISC is valuable for cybersecurity professionals because it offers timely and detailed information on current threats and vulnerabilities. By staying updated with the ISC's daily reports, professionals can enhance their situational awareness and improve their organization's security posture. The resource is especially beneficial for those involved in incident response, threat hunting, and network defense.

#### OWASP
- Title: Open Worldwide Application Security Project

- URL: owasp.org/ 

- Abstract: As the world's largest non-profit organization that is concerned with software security, OWASP supports the creation of impactful projects and providing resources meant to educate the masses in order to make better software that is more secure. Their core values are open, being transparent with their development, innovative, encouraging new trains of thoughts, global, allowing participants all over, and integrity, supporting and respecting one another in the OWASP community.

- Why it is useful for professionals: OWASP provides an abundance of resources for cybersecurity professionals to create, promote, and maintain secure and robust code. Their resources create the standard for programming and security practices in the industry. Through regularly consulting these resources, programmers and security consultants' security posture will be aligned with what's current in the industry.

#### Shodan
- Title: Shodan

- URL: https://www.shodan.io

- Abstract: Shodan is essentially a search engine for any device connected to the internet. Everything from open cameras, routers, servers, mobile devices, etc... can be looked up. This tool is particularly useful for reconnaissance which is first stage of the cyber kill chain. According to Wikipedia, it gathers data from HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, SSH, Telnet, SNMP, IMAP, SMTP, SIP, and RTSP. RTSP is port 554 which is used for camera devices.

- Why it is useful for professionals: Shodan can streamline the process of reconnaissance for many cybersecurity professionals. I actually remember using it back when I was around 13 years old to search for cameras from all over the world. I was able to login to these IP cameras using default credentials like admin/admin or admin/password and I saw a large variety of things like inside people's houses, secure facilities, street cameras, etc... Nowadays, these IP cameras aren't as unsecure so there was barely any left on Shodan last I checked. I believe that this experience stresses the need for everyone to avoid using default credentials. Shodan streamlined the process of finding IP cameras for me which allowed me to do some reconnaissance, albeit for no meaningful purpose whatsoever.

#### Awesome Cyber Security University
- Title: Awesome Cyber Security University

- URL: https://github.com/brootware/awesome-cyber-security-university

- Abstract: Awesome Cyber Security University is a GitHub repo containing a curated list of free educational resources that focus on learning through multiple practice stages. It has six levels to clear, which each increase in difficulty as someone progresses through them. They also have badges that allow users to certify that they completed these challenges. CTF challenges are also prevalent in this repo, and they are a gamified version of cybersecurity that challenges users with finding a specific piece of information, called a flag. The goal of these challenges is to find this flag that is being protected. 

- Why it's useful: This is useful because it can benefit not just cybersecurity professionals, but also beginners, as the six stages allow for people of any experience to attempt challenges that they feel comfortable doing. For professionals, the "Extremely Hard Rooms to do" section can give them many difficult exercises to brush up on, and the tools covered in the course are very varied, even offering things like Ghidra and Assembly. Overall, this is a useful repository for free cybersecurity practice at any level of skill. 

#### Cisco Talos Intelligence Group
- Title: Cisco Talos Intelligence Group

From SANS Institute: "These open source digital forensics tools can be used in a wide variety of investigations including cross validation of tools, providing insight into technical details not exposed by other tools, and more. Over the years, Eric has written and continually improve over a dozen digital forensics tools that investigators all over the world use and rely upon daily."

- Why it is useful for professionals: Professional security analysts specializing in post-incident response and recovery can use digital forensics tools to investigate an attack. Eric Zimmerman has compiled and built tools that not only work great, but also come for free as they're open-source. By staying free, costs for investigation are minimized.
