# Incident Response Planning

## Risk Assessment
- Comparing likelihood and severity of an issue
- Matrix is a grid form where left to right is minimal to no severity to very high severity and top to bottom is very likely to highly unlikely
- Color coded to indicate risk priority
- Ex. Phishing is very likely and very high severity for organizations with public facing email addresses
- CISA can help with creating a risk assessment matrix

## Incident Response Action Plan or IRAP
- Organizations need to be prepared for incidents and know how to respond to them
- Determine what to do, who does it, when, and who is informed
- Components
    - Purpose of IRAP
        - Illustrates response to different types of threats
        - In our case study, SGIP consortium board, it serves to be a response to NIST implementation
    - Scope of IRAP
        - What systems does the IRAP apply to
        - Local systems, partner systems, interlinked systems
    - General definition of a security incident that would require implementation of IRAP
        - How do you generally define a security incident that would be covered under this IRAP?
            - System breaches from insider/external threats
            - Data breaches
            - System failures
            - Integrity of systems and data
            - Availability of resources, etc...
    - RACI for critical responders
        - Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed
        - Who should be one of or a combination of the above classifications for each area or stage of an attack
        - When an issue is identified, users may report to customer support (R), who works with incident response intake (R, C, I), who notifies incident response team (A), who notifies CISO (I)
        - Stages could be
            - Identification
            - Classification
            - Determination
            - Escalation
            - Investigation
            - Diagnosis
            - Implementation
            - Resolution
            - Recovery
            - Communication
            - Forensics
            - After-action
    - Incident response steps
        - A flow chart of how to handle an incident
        - Uses an illustration while each step includes details that could be one to two sentences each
    - Recommended plans
        - Additional details or short plan for each step
- Cisco has a primer for developing an incident response plan
