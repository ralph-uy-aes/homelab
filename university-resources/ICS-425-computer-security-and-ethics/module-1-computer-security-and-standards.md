# Computer Security and Standards

## Overview
- Aspects of Security
- Security Goals
- Standards and Frameworks
- NIST
- Assignments

## Aspects of Security
- Comes down to three things:
1. Vulnerabilities - weaknesses that can be exploited in a system to cause harm; ex. unauthorized users can access confidential data
2. Threat - set of circumstances that can cause loss or harm of assets; ex. user logs into a part of a system that stores confidential data
3. Control - a protective measure, policy, or technology that removes or reduces vulnerabilities; ex. password-protection of encrypted data
- Threat is blocked by Control of a Vulnerability (TCV)

## Security Goals: CIAA
1. Confidentiality or Secrecy - only authorized parties can access an asset
2. Integrity - only authorized parties can modify an asset
3. Availability - assets are accessible or modifiable by authorized parties at appropriate times and are never denied access
4. Audit - an attacker cannot hide his tracks; forensic analysis is possible

## Standards and Frameworks
- National Institute of Standards (NIST)
- International Organization for Standardization (ISO/IEC 27001)
- Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT)
- Cyber Risk Institute (CRI)
- ETC (Et Cetera hehe :D)
- Cybersecurity pros actually use many of these and are agile in between switching up between different frameworks

## National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
- Created by the US Government
- Free for anyone to use
- Composed of: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover
- A center ring of "Govern" was added in 2024 and is meant to be connected to all of the five parts
1. Govern (GV) - The organization's cybersecurity risk management strategy, expectations, and policy are established, communicated, and monitored
2. Identify (ID) - The organization's current cybersecurity risks are understood
3. Protect (PR) - Safeguards to manage the organization's cybersecurity risks are used
4. Detect (DE) - Possible cybersecurity attacks and compromises are found and analyzed
5. Respond (RS) - Actions regarding a detected cybersecurity incident are taken
6. Recover (RC) - Assets and operations affected by a cybersecurity incident are restored
