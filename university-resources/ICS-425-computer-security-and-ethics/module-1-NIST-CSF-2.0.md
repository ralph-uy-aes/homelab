# Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0

## Section 1 - Overview

#### Components of CSF 2.0
1. CSF Core
    - The nucleus of CSF
    - Contains high-level cybersecurity outcomes to help organizations manage cybersecurity risks
    - Hierarchy of functions, categories, and subcategories
    - Can be easily understood by anyone regardless of experience
    - Neutral, therefore flexible to every organization
2. CSF Organizational Profiles
    - Mechanisms for describing an organization's current and/or target cybersecurity posture in terms of CSF Core's outcomes
3. CSF Tiers
    - Can be applied or used with Organizational Profiles to characterize how strong an organization's cybersecurity practices and governance are
    - Provide context for how an organization views cybersecurity risks as a whole and their processes for such risks

#### Resources
- Informative References - point to sources of guidance on each outcome from existing standards, guidelines, frameworks, etc...
- Implementation Examples - potential ways to achieve each outcome
- Quick-Start Guides - actionable guidance on using CSF and its online resources
- Community Profiles and Organizational Profile Templates - help an organization put CSF into practice and set priorities for managing cybersecurity risks

#### Organizations
- Understand and Assess
    - Describe the current and target cybersecurity posture
    - Determine gaps
    - Assess progress toward addressing gaps
- Prioritize
    - Identify, organize, and prioritize actions to manage cybersecurity risks
    - Must align with organization's mission, legal and regulatory requirements, and risk management
- Communicate
    - Provide a common language to communicate inside and outside organization about cybersecurity risks, capabilities, needs, and expectations

#### Core Structure
- Section 2 - explains the basics of the CSF Core
- Section 3 - defines the concepts of CSF Profiles and Tiers
- Section 4 - provides an overview of selected CSF resources
- Section 5 - discusses how an organization can integrate CSF with other risk management programs
- Appendix A - the CSF Core
- Appendix B - contains a notional illustration of CSF Tiers
- Appendix C - glossary of CSF terminology

## Section 2 - Introduction to the CSF Core

#### Components of CSF Core
- Functions > Categories > Subcategories
- The outcomes listed are not a checklist, they're suggestions that may or may not be taken by organizations depending on what they need

#### CSF Core Functions
1. Govern (GV)
    - The organization's cybersecurity risk management strategy, expectations, and policy
        - These need to be established, communicated, and monitored
    - Informs organizations in terms of what they could do to achieve and prioritize the outcomes of the other five functions
    - Critical for incorporating cybersecurity into an organization's Enterprise Risk Management or ERM
    - Addresses an understanding of organizational context
        - Establish cybersecurity strategy
2. Identify (ID)
    - The organization's cybersecurity risks are understood
    - Organization's assets, suppliers, and cybersecurity risks must be understood
    - Includes identification of improvement opportunities for organization's cybersecurity risk management
3. Protect (PR)
    - The organization's safeguards against cybersecurity risks
    - Once you identify and prioritize assets and risks, protect them
        - Secure the assets to prevent or reduce the likelihood of adverse events
    - Outcomes include: identity management, authentication, and access control
        - Awareness and training, data and platform security, and tech infrastructure resilience
4. Detect (DE)
    - The organization's possible attack vectors and compromises must be found and analyzed
    - Time is of essence in terms of discovery and analysis of anomalies, indicators of compromise, and other adverse events
    - Successful incident response and recovery activities
5. Respond (RS)
    - The organization's actions in the event of a detected cybersecurity incident
    - Outcomes include: incident management, analysis, mitigation, reporting, and communication
6. Recover (RC)
    - The organization's assets and operations after an incident must be restored
    - Timely restoration and normal operations reduce the effects of cybersecurity incidents and enable appropriate communication
- The wheel of core functions show how they relate to one another and how they may be cyclical
- Governance is at the center because it connects all of the other five functions and determines them
- GV, ID, PR, DE should be continuous efforts
- RS, RC should be timely and ready efforts
- GV, ID, PR help prevent and prepare for incidents
- GV, DE, RS, RC help discover and manage incidents
- Each function is divided further into categories that are further divided into subcategories
    - Categories are broad outcomes associated with the functions
    - Subcategories are precise, but not exhaustive, outcomes
