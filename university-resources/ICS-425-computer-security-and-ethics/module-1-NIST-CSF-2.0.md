# Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0

## Section 1 - Overview

#### Components of CSF 2.0
1. CSF Core
    - The nucleus of CSF
    - Contains high-level cybersecurity outcomes to help organizations manage cybersecurity risks
    - Hierarchy of functions, categories, and subcategories
    - Can be easily understood by anyone regardless of experience
    - Neutral, therefore flexible to every organization
2. CSF Organizational Profiles
    - Mechanisms for describing an organization's current and/or target cybersecurity posture in terms of CSF Core's outcomes
3. CSF Tiers
    - Can be applied or used with Organizational Profiles to characterize how strong an organization's cybersecurity practices and governance are
    - Provide context for how an organization views cybersecurity risks as a whole and their processes for such risks

#### Resources
- Informative References - point to sources of guidance on each outcome from existing standards, guidelines, frameworks, etc...
- Implementation Examples - potential ways to achieve each outcome
- Quick-Start Guides - actionable guidance on using CSF and its online resources
- Community Profiles and Organizational Profile Templates - help an organization put CSF into practice and set priorities for managing cybersecurity risks

#### Organizations
- Understand and Assess
    - Describe the current and target cybersecurity posture
    - Determine gaps
    - Assess progress toward addressing gaps
- Prioritize
    - Identify, organize, and prioritize actions to manage cybersecurity risks
    - Must align with organization's mission, legal and regulatory requirements, and risk management

## Section 2 - Introduction to the CSF Core

#### Components of CSF Core
- Functions > Categories > Subcategories
- The outcomes listed are not a checklist, they're suggestions that may or may not be taken by organizations depending on what they need

#### CSF Core Functions
1. Govern (GV)
    - The organization's cybersecurity risk management strategy, expectations, and policy
        - These need to be established, communicated, and monitored
    - Informs organizations in terms of what they could do to achieve and prioritize the outcomes of the other five functions
    - Critical for incorporating cybersecurity into an organization's Enterprise Risk Management or ERM
    - Addresses an understanding of organizational context
        - Establish cybersecurity strategy
2. Identify (ID)
    - The organization's cybersecurity risks are understood
    - Organization's assets, suppliers, and cybersecurity risks must be understood
    - Includes identification of improvement opportunities for organization's cybersecurity risk management
3. Protect (PR)
    - The organization's safeguards against cybersecurity risks
    - Once you identify and prioritize assets and risks, protect them
        - Secure the assets to prevent or reduce the likelihood of adverse events
    - Outcomes include: identity management, authentication, and access control
        - Awareness and training, data and platform security, and tech infrastructure resilience
4. Detect (DE)
    - The organization's possible attack vectors and compromises must be found and analyzed
    - Time is of essence in terms of discovery and analysis of anomalies, indicators of compromise, and other adverse events
    - Successful incident response and recovery activities
5. Respond (RS)
    - The organization's actions in the event of a detected cybersecurity incident
    - Outcomes include: incident management, analysis, mitigation, reporting, and communication
6. Recover (RC)
    - The organization's assets and operations after an incident must be restored
    - Timely restoration and normal operations reduce the effects of cybersecurity incidents and enable appropriate communication
- The wheel of core functions show how they relate to one another and how they may be cyclical
- Governance is at the center because it connects all of the other five functions and determines them
- GV, ID, PR, DE should be continuous efforts
- RS, RC should be timely and ready efforts
- GV, ID, PR help prevent and prepare for incidents
- GV, DE, RS, RC help discover and manage incidents
- Each function is divided further into categories that are further divided into subcategories
    - Categories are broad outcomes associated with the functions
    - Subcategories are precise, but not exhaustive, outcomes

## Section 3 - Introduction to CSF Profiles and Tiers

#### CSF Profiles
- A CSF Organizational Profile is essentially the current and/or target cybersecurity posture of an organization based on CSF Core outcomes
- These profiles are used to understand, assess, prioritize, and communicate Core outcomes by considering: mission objectives, stakeholder expectations, threat landscape, and requirements.
- An organization can then prioritize its actions to achieve specific outcomes and communicate that information to stakeholders
- Includes:
1. Current Profile - what an organization is currently achieving and to what extent each outcome is being achieved in terms of CSF Core
2. Target Profile - desired outcomes for an organization, selected and prioritized in order to achieve risk management objectives; considers anticipated changes to cybersecurity posture using new requirements, new technology, and threat intelligence trends
- Steps:
1. Scope the Organizational Profile
    - Document high-level facts and assumptions to define the scope of the profile
    - This is a lot like shopping for security systems
    - Do you want everything to make your organization as secure as currently possible or just prioritize the essentials
2. Gather Information to Prepare the Organizational Profile
    - Information sources may be organizational policies, risk management priorities and resources, enterprise risk profiles, business impact analysis registers, cybersecurity requirements and standards of the organization, etc...
3. Create the Organizational Profile
    - Determine what types of information the profile should include for the selected CSF outcomes and document the needed information
    - Consider the risk implications of the Current profile to inform Target profile planning and prioritization
    - Consider using a community profile as the basis for the target profile
4. Analyze Gaps Between Current and Target Profiles
    - Conduct gap analysis to identify differences between the current and target profiles
    - Develop a prioritized action plan using risk register, risk detail reports, plan of action and milestones to address gaps
5. Implement Action Plan, Update Organizational Profile
    - Follow the action plan to address the gaps and move the organization toward the target profile
    - An action plan may have an overall deadline or be ongoing

#### CSF Tiers
- Tiers are levels that describe the rigor of an organization's cybersecurity risk governance and management practices
- They provide context for how an organization views cyber risks and the processes in place to manage risks
- Four tiers from highest to lowest:
1. Partial
2. Risk-informed
3. Repeatable
4. Adaptive
- Tiers are meant to complement an organization's risk management methodology rather than replace it
- Tiers can be used to benchmark
- Progression to higher tiers is encouraged when risks or mandates are greater or when a cost-benefit analysis indicates that it is feasible and cost effective to reduce negative risks

## Section 4 - Introduction to Online Resources that Supplement CSF

#### Resource List
1. Informative References
    - Mappings that indicate relationships between core and various standards, guidelines, regulations, and other content
    - Help inform how an organization could achieve core outcomes
    - Can be sector or technology specific
    - Narrower in scope than a subcategory
    - Can be references from NIST or other organizations
2. Implementation Examples
    - Examples of concise steps to help achieve subcategory outcomes
    - Verbs used to express examples are: share, document, develop, perform, monitor, analyze, assess, and exercise
    - Not a comprehensive list of all actions, nor a baseline of required actions
3. Quick-Start Guides
    - Brief documents on specific CSF-related topics, often tailored to specific audiences
    - Help organizations implement the CSF because they turn CSF into actionable first steps to be considered
    - Revised and updated with new guides as needed

## Section 5 - Improving Cybersecurity Risk Communication and Integration

#### Improving Risk Management Communication
- CSF fosters bidirectional information flow between executives and managers
    - Executives focus on organization priorities and direction
    - Managers manage specific risks that could affect the achievement of those priorities
- CSF also supports bidirectional communication flow between managers and practitioners who implement and operate the technologies
    - Practitioners share updates, insights, and concerns

##### Improving Integration with Other Risk Management Programs
- Every organization faces types of ICT risk and may use frameworks and management tools that are specific to each risk
- Some organizations integrate ICT and all other risk management efforts at a high level by using ERM
    - Others keep efforts separate to ensure adequate attention on each
- Other programs to consider:
    - Cybersecurity risk management and assessment
    - Privacy risks
    - Supply chain risks
    - Risks from emerging technologies
