# Software Vulnerabilities

#### CVE
- Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) is a list of computer security flaws
- A CVE is a security flaw that's been assigned a CVE ID number
    - Advisories issued by vendors and researchers almost always mention at least 1 CVE ID
- These help IT professionals address and prioritize vulnerabilities to make systems secure

#### CVE System
- MITRE developed the CVE System in 1999
- Report and track software security bugs
- CVEs are short, more technical data come in other databases ike the NVD or CERT/CC Vulnerability Notes Database, etc...
- CVE IDs allow users to recognize unique vulnerabilities and develop security tools and solutions
- MITRE maintains this list, but a CVE entry is often submitted by third-parties

#### CVE Identifiers
- Assigned by the CVE Numbering Authority (CNA)
    - Approximately 100 CNAs, different vendors, organizations, security companies, etc...
- CNAs are issued blocks of CVE IDs which CNAs reserve
    - When a new issue is found, they can use these reserves
- A single complex product like an OS can have hundreds of CVEs
    - When end of life comes to these products (no more bug fixes or security patches), they accumulate more and more CVEs
- Vendors can offer bug bounties to incentivize users into finding vulnerabilities
- When the CNA receives a valid report, they assign a new CVE ID to the vulnerability
    - A new CVE is then posted on the CVE website
- A CNA assigns a CVE ID before making the advisory public
    - Before publicizing it, it must be patched to prevent attackers from exploiting it
- The CVE ID, a brief description of the security vulnerability or exposure, and references including links to vulnerability reports and advisories are included in the CVE entry

#### CVE Qualifications
- CVE IDs are assigned to flaws that are:
    - Independently fixable
        - Can be fixed independently of any other bugs
    - Acknowledged by the affected vendor or documented
        - Vendor confirms and acknowledges the bug's existence and negative impact to security
        - Reported must have shared a vulnerability report that demonstrates both negative impact of the bug and violation of security policy
    - Affect only 1 codebase
        - If it impacts more than 1 product, it gets a separate CVE for each
        - The flaw gets a single CVE only if there's no way to use the shared code without being vulnerable
        - Each affected codebase or product gets a unique CVE

#### Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
- A set of open standards for assigning a number to a vulnerability to assess its severity
- Scores range from 0.0 to 10.0, higher means more severe
- Some vendors have their own scoring systems

#### Takeaways
- Know your deployments
    - Because a CVE exists doesn't mean the risk applies to your environment and deployment
    - Read each CVE to validate its relevance to your environment
- Practice Vulnerability Management
    - Repeatable process to identify, classify, prioritize, remediate, and mitigate vulnerabilities
    - Understand how a risk would apply to your organization so you can prioritize any outstanding vulnerabilities that must be addressed
- Be Ready to Communicate
    - CVEs will impact your organization's systems because of both the vulnerabilities themselves and any potential downtime required to address them
    - Communicate and coordinate with customers
    - Share vulnerabilities with any central risk-management function in your organization

#### Red Hat
- Continuously engaged in security community
- CNA and uses CVE IDs to track vulnerabilities
- Red Hat Product Security provides access to raw security data on the consumer portal
