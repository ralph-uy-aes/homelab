# Lecture 2a - Computer Architecture

#### Generation 0: Mechanical Calculators
- Abacus
    - Invented around 500BC
    - Aide for mental calculation
- Pascaline
    - 1642
    - Blaise Pascal
    - A true calculator
    - Pascaline was a mechanical calculator
    - Used to help Pascal's father with tax computations
    - Did addition and subtraction, no memory, no programming
- Stepped Reckoner
    - 1671
    - Gottfried von Leibniz
    - Added functions such as multiplications, divisions, square roots
- None had memory, required human intervention at each step
- Difference Engine
    - The first true computer
    - Charles Babbage
    - 1822
    - Automated computation of polynomial functions
    - Based on method of finite difference
        - Polynomial values can be computed without ever having to do a multiplication
    - Implements some storage
        - All internal and temporary, the user doesn't store anything
- Analytical Engine
    - Also Charles Babbage
    - 1833
    - Much more general than difference engine and could perform "any" math operation
    - First machine that somewhat resembles computers
        - Arithmetic processing unit (the mill)
        - A memory (the store)
        - Input/output (punched metal cards)
    - In 1843, Ada Lovelace wrote the first instructions for the Analytical Machine
        - She wrote the first computer program
        - Computed the Bernoulli numbers
        - Ada was named after her

#### Generation 1: Vacuum Tubes
- First known device to amplify, switch, or modify a signal
    - Did what babbage did but with electricity
- 1930s
    - Konrad Zuse designed a machine similar to the Analytical Engine
    - Lacked funds
    - Used electromechanical relays instead
        - Nazis didn't believe in his research, so he had to build using relays
    - Allied forces destroyed his machines (Z1, Z2, Z3) during bombing of Berlin
        - If the Nazis had funded his research WW2 might've been different
  
#### Generation 1: ENIAC
- Electronic NUmerical Integrator and Computer
- Unveiled in 1946
- Designed by Mauchly and Eckert
- First all-electronic, general-purpose digital computer
- Similar to ABC computer
- Programmed during WW2 by a team of 6 women
- Specs
    - 17,468 vacuum tubes
    - 1,800 sqft
    - 30 tons
    - 174 kW of power
    - 1,000-bit memory

#### Generation 1: New Concepts
- Use of binary
    - Claude Shannon proposed binary arithmetic and boolean logic should be used with electronic circuits in the 30s
- Von-Neumann Architecture
    - John von Neumann learned about ENIAC and joined the group
    - 3 Hardware systems
        - CPU
        - Memory (stores both program and data)
        - I/O System
    - Computers still follow this design today

#### Generation 2: Transistors
- Just like a vacuum tube, but without all the mechanical drawbacks
- ENIAC was rebuilt using transistors
- Still really big, but small compared to ENIAC
- IBM sold transistor-based computers
- CDC 6600 was the fist supercomputer
    - $10M, 10-million instructions/sec
- Transistor-based computers enabled space travel and other advances

#### Generation 3: Integrated Circuits
- Transistors get smaller every year and get packed and compressed into small circuits
- IBM was the first brand to build a computer using entirely Integrated Circuits

#### Generation 4: VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration)
- A CPU was packed into a single chip called a microprocessor
    - Intel beat everyone to the race by creating the first microprocessor in the market
- Basically, an ENIAC in a chip
    - In 1997, the 50th anniversary of the ENIAC was actually rebuilt at U. Penn into a single chip
- Microprocessors enabled the creation of personal computers
    - 1977's Apple II and 1981 IBM PC

#### Generation 5
- Stupid term used after generation 4
- Nobody cares about this term anymore
