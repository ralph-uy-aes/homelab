# 1.4 Encrypting Data

#### Encrypting Stored Data
- Protecting data on storage devices
    - SSD, hard drive, USB drive, cloud storage, etc...
    - Data at rest
- Full-disk and partition or volume encryption
    - BitLocker, FileVault, etc...
- File Encryption
    - Encrypting File System (EFS), third party utilities

#### Database Encryption
- Protecting stored data and its transmission
- Transparent encryption
    - Encrypt all database information with a symmetric key
- Record-level encryption
    - Encrypt individual columns
    - Use separate symmetric keys per column
    - Reduces overhead, like only encrypting SSN or credit card number columns for example

#### Transport Encryption
- Protect data traversing the network
    - You're probably doing this now
- Encrypting in the application
    - Browsers communicate using HTTPS
- Virtual Private Network (VPN)
    - Creates an encrypted tunnel between two firewalls or VPN concentrators
    - Site-to-site VPN using IPsec
    - Client-based CPN using SSL/TLS

#### Encryption Algorithms
- Both sides must use the same algorithm
    - Both sides decide on the algorithm prior to encryption
    - Details are often hidden from the end user, but could know what type of application they're using
- There are advantages and disadvantages to different algorithms
    - Security, speed, complexity of implementation, etc...

#### Cryptographic Keys
- We know exactly how they work, the algorithms are public
    - What we don't know is the key
    - We all know how a regular door lock works, but we don't have the key to all door locks
- Key determines the output
    - Encrypting
    - Hashing
    - Digitally Signing
- Keep those private keys private

#### Key Lengths
- Larger keys tend to be more secure
    - Prevents brute-force attacks
    - Attackers can try every possible key combination
- Symmetric encryption
    - 128-bit or larger symmetric keys are common
    - Numbers get larger and larger as time goes on
- Asymmetric encryption
    - Complex calculations prime numbers
    - Larger keys than symmetric encryption
    - Common to see 3072 bits or larger keys

#### Key Stretching
- We may need to keep making larger and larger keys as time goes on
- Or we could perform the encryption process multiple times for a piece of data
    - Referred to as key stretching or key strengthening
- Brute force attacks require reversing each of those hashes
    - Even if the keys are small, you need to do it again and again
