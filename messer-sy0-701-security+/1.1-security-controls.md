# 1.1 Security Controls

#### Security Controls
- Prevent security events, minimize impact, and limit the damage of attacks

#### Control Categories
- Technical Controls
    - Controls implemented using systems
    - Operating system controls
    - Prevent some functions for some users
    - Ex. Firewalls, Antivirus
- Managerial Controls
    - Administrative controls associated with security design and implementation
    - Ex. Security policies, standard operating procedures
- Operational Controls
    - Controls implemented by people instead of systems
    - Ex. Security guards, awareness programs, posters
- Physical Controls
    - Limit physical access
    - Ex. Guard shacks, fences, locks, badge readers

#### Preventive Control Types
- Limit or prevent access to a resource
- Category Examples
    - Technical - Firewall
    - Managerial - On-boarding policy
    - Operational - Guard shack
    - Physical - Door lock

#### Deterrent Control Types
- Discourage an intrusion attempt
- Does not directly prevent access
- Attackers think twice
- Category Examples
    - Technical - Application splash screens
    - Managerial - Demotion or termination threat
    - Operational - Front reception desk
    - Physical - Warning signs

#### Detective Control Types
- Identify and log intrusion attempts
- Does not need to block access
- Category Examples
    - Technical - Collect and review system logs
    - Managerial - Review login reports
    - Operational - Patrol guard
    - Physical - Motion detectors

#### Corrective Control Types
- Apply a control following an event or intrusion
- Reverses the impact of an event
- Continue operations with minimal downtime
- Category Examples
    - Technical - Backups to mitigate ransomware impact
    - Managerial - Create policies to report security issues
    - Operational - Contact law enforcement to manage criminal activity
    - Physical - Fire extinguisher to put out fires

#### Compensating Control Types
- Backups for when an incident happens and resources aren't sufficient
- Temporary controls for when existing controls aren't enough
- Temporarily prevent further damage or exploitation of a weakness
- Category Examples
    - Technical - Firewall blocks a specific application instead of patching the app
    - Managerial - Implement separation of duties
    - Operational - Require simultaneous guard duties
    - Physical - Generator used after power outage

#### Directive Control Types
- Direct a subject towards security compliance
- Relatively weak compared to other controls
- "Do this, please"
- Category Examples
    - Technical - Store sensitive files in a protected folder
    - Managerial - Create compliance policies and procedures
    - Operational - Train users on property security policy
    - Physical - Authorized personnel only signs

#### Managing Security Controls
- Many security controls are combined in real environments
- Organizations may use very different controls
- New security controls are created as systems and processes evolve
