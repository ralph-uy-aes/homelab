# 1.2 Physical Security

#### Barricades or Bollards
- Prevents access
    - Limits to its prevention
- Channel people through a specific access point and keep other things out
    - Allow people, prevent vehicles
- Identifies safety concerns and prevents injuries
- Can be used to an extreme such as in moats

#### Access Control Vestibules
- All doors are normally unlocked
    - Opening one door causes others to lock 
- All doors are normally locked
    - Unlocking one door prevents others from being unlocked
- One door open, other door locked
    - When one is open, the other can't be unlocked
- One at a time, controlled groups
    - Managed control through an area

#### Fencing
- Builds a perimeter
    - Usually very obvious
    - May not be the exact control you want
- Can be transparent or opaque
- Should be robust and difficult to destroy
- Prevent climbing using razor wire or by building it high

#### Video Surveillance
- CCTV
    - Can replace physical guards or be operated by one
- Camera features are important
    - Motion recognition can alarm and alert for movement
    - Object detection can identify license plates or faces
- Often networked together and recorded over time

#### Guards and Access Badges
- Security Guard
    - Physical protection at the reception area of a facility
    - Validate identification of employees or guests
- Two-person integrity or control
    - Minimize exposure to an attack
    - No single person has access to a physical asset
    - More than one person creates checks and balances
- Access Badge
    - Must be worn at all times
    - Electronically logged
    - Visible to everyone to show that you're allowed to be there

#### Lighting
- Illuminating areas usually means more security for that area
- Attackers avoid light as they're easier to see
- Non-IR cameras can see better, but IR cameras can see in the dark
- Specialized design
    - Consider overall light levels and light angles
    - Avoid shadows and glares

#### Sensors
- Infrared
    - Detect infrared radiation in both light and dark areas
    - Common in motion detectors
    - Don't need lights
- Pressure
    - Detects a change in force
    - Floor and window sensors
- Microwave
    - Detects movement across large areas
    - Designed to detect movement over a larger area, a bit more efficient than IR
- Ultrasonic
    - Sends ultrasonic signals, looking for reflected sound waves
    - Detects motion and collision
