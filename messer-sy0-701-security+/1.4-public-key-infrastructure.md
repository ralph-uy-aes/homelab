# 1.4 Public Key Infrastructure

#### Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
- Policies, procedures, hardware, software, people
    - Responsible for creating, distributing, managing, storing, and revoking digital certificates
- Big, big endeavor with lots of planning
- Also refers to binding public keys to people or devices
    - Involves a certificate authority CA
    - All about trust

#### Symmetric Encryption
- A single shared key
    - Whatever key encrypted data will also be used to decrypt it
    - If this single key is exposed, you need a new one
- AKA Secret key algorithm
    - A shared secret (key)
- Doesn't scale very well
    - Can be challenging to distribute a single key that's supposed to be secret
    - How is it a secret if everyone knows it?
- Very fast to use
    - Less overhead than asymmetric encryption
- Often this is combined with asymmetric encryption

#### Asymmetric Encryption
- Public key cryptography
    - Two different, but mathematically related keys
- Private key
    - Only one person or device has access to this
    - Kept private
- Public key
    - Anyone can see this key
- The private key is the only key that can decrypt data
- The public key is used to encrypt data
- You can't derive the private key from the public key
    - No way to mathematically get the private from public key

#### Key Pair
- Key generation
    - Simultaneously build the public and private key
    - Lots of randomization
    - Large prime numbers
    - Lots and lots of math
- Everyone can have the public key, private key is only owned by creator of the keys

#### Asymmetric Encryption Process
- Bob encrypts plaintext with Alice's public key and creates a Ciphertext
- Bob sends Ciphertext to Alice
- Alice receives the Ciphertext and decrypts it with her private key
- Alice now sees the plaintext

#### Key Escrow
- Someone else holds your decryption keys
    - Private keys are in the hands of a third party
    - May be within your own organization
- Good for scalability as holding on to so many keys is difficult and can be unsecure
- Can be a legitimate business arrangement
    - Business might need access to employee information
    - Government agencies may need to decrypt partner data
- Controversial because you're giving private keys to someone else
    - May be required to maintain uptime
