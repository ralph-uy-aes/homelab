# 2.3 Hardware Vulnerabilities

#### Hardware Vulnerabilities
- We are surrounded by hardware devices connected to the network
    - Many of which don't have an accessible operating system
- These devices are potential security issues
    - Perfect entry point for an attack
- Everything is connected to the network
    - IoT devices are everywhere
    - Lights, refrigerators, door locks, garage doors
- The security landscape has grown

#### Firmware
- The software inside of the hardware
    - Operating system inside of a hardware device
- The only people who can update or manage these systems are the manufacturers themselves
- Unfortunately, hardware manufacturers don't care about security as much as we do
- Trane Comfortlink II Thermostats
    - Automated thermostats that were controllable from the phone
    - Trane was notified of three vulnerabilities in April 2014
        - Only released 2 patches a year later, and another almost 2 years later

#### End Of Life (EOL)
- When a device is no longer able to updated
- Notice that tells everyone that
    - Manufacturer will stop selling a product
    - They may still continue supporting the product for some time
- End of Service Life (EOSL)
    - Manufacturer no longer supports the product
    - May have a premium-cost support option
    - May be better to replace the device entirely
- Technology EOSL is a significant concern
    - Security patches are healthy for a normal operation

#### Legacy Platforms
- Some devices remained installed for a long time already
- Legacy devices often have older OS, applications, middleware
- May be running EOL software
    - Risk needs to be compared to the return
- May require additional security protections
    - Additional firewall rules
    - IPS signatures for older OS
- Hard to phase out, may be easier to secure
