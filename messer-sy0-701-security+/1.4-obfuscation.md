# 1.4 Obfuscation

#### Obfuscation
- Taking something that is regularly easy to understand and making it more unclear or abstract
    - But not impossible to understand
- Hiding information in plain sight
    - Can be reversed if you understand it, unlike encryption
- Hiding information inside of an image
    - Steganography

#### Steganography
- Greek for concealed writing
- Security through obscurity
- Message is invisible, but it's really there
- Covertext
    - The container of the document or file

#### Common Steganography Techniques
- Network based
    - Embed messages within TCP packets
    - If you know how data is being sent, you can reconstruct it as the receiver
- Use an image
    - Embed the message in the image itself
- Invisible watermarks
    - Yellow dots on printers
    - Printed pages have small yellow dots printed with them that are unique to each printer
        - Machine identification codes can be used to match outputs to printers
- Audio steganography
    - Modify the audio file
    - Interlace a secret message within the audio
    - Similar to image steganography
- Video steganography
    - A sequence of images
    - Use image steganography on a larger scale
    - Manage the signal to noise ratio
    - Potentially transfer much more information

#### Tokenization
- Replace sensitive data with a non-sensitive placeholder
    - SSN: 266-12-1112 is now 691-61-8539
- Common with credit card processing
    - A temporary token is created from your credit card network
    - One-time use and is sent over networks
        - Attackers capturing the card numbers can't use them later
- Not encryption or hashing
    - Original data and token aren't mathematically related
- Process
    - Credit card number is registered on a mobile phone
    - Credit card is sent to a remote token service server
    - Token service server provides a token instead
    - Phone is used at a store during checkout using NFC
    - Pays with the tokenized form of the credit card number
    - Merchant sends the tokenized form to the remote token service server
    - Remote token service server validates the token and approves the merchant to process
    - Token is released and can no longer be used
    - Phone requests a new token from the server for the next transaction

#### Data Masking
- Data obfuscation
      - Hide some of the original data
      - For credit cards, imagine only showing the last four digits and everything else is asterisks
- Protects PII and other sensitive data
- May only be hidden from view
    - Data is still intact in storage
    - Control the view based on permissions
- Many different techniques
    - Substituting, shuffling, encrypting, masking
