# 2.3 SQL Injection

#### Code Injection
- Attacker puts their code into a data stream
- Enabled because of bad programming
    - Applications should be able to handle input and output
- Many different code injections
    - HTML, SQL, XML, LDAP, etc...

#### SQL Injection
- Structured Query Language
    - Most common relational database management system language
- SQL injection (SQLi)
    - Attacker puts their own request in the query for a database
    - Applications shouldn't allow this
- can often be executed in a web browser
    - Inject data via form or field

#### Building an SQL Injection
- Example:
    - `SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '"+ userName +"';`
    - `SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'Professor' OR '1' = '1';`
- Additional code is added to pull data
- Could be very bad
    - View all database information, delete database information, add users, deny service, etc...

#### SQL Injection Demonstration
- A site has two forms
    - Employee Name: `Smith`
    - Authentication TAN: `3SL99A`
- You could include additional injected code in either field
    - Employee Name: `Smith`
    - Authentication TAN: `'3SL99A' or '1' = '1'`
- Once submitted, it pulls every record whenever `'1' = '1'`
    - AKA everything in the database
