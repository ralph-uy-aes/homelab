# 2.3 Cross-Site Scripting

#### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Not CSS because that stands for something else
- Vulnerabilities found inside browsers
    - Information from one site could be shared with another site
- One of the most common vulnerabilities for web apps
    - Takes advantage of the trust a user has for a site
    - Complex and varied
- XSS are based around JavaScript
    - Almost everyone has JS enabled in their browser
- Procedure
    - Attacker sends a link to the victim containing a malicious script
    - Victim clicks link and takes them to a legitimate site
    - Legitimate site loads in the victim's browser, along with the malicious script of the attacker
    - Malicious script sends victim's data such as cookies to the attacker

#### Non-Persistent or Reflected XSS Attack
- Third-party website is configured to enable users to run scripts in user input fields
    - Search boxes are common
- Attacker emails link that takes advantage of this vulnerability
- Scripts embedded in the URL executes in the victim's browser
    - The attacker sends the script, the victim executes it on their own accord
- Attacker uses credentials, session IDs, cookies to steal victim's information without their knowledge

#### Persistent or Stored XSS Attack
- Attacker posts a message to a social network
    - Includes the malicious payload
- Now it is persistent because everyone who visits that page has that code run in their browser
    - Everyone gets the payload
- There is no specific target, everyone is attacked
    - All viewers are attacked
- For social networking, this can spread quickly
    - Users share the link, more users click the link

#### Hacking a Subaru
- June 2017, Aaron Guzman
- When authenticating with Subaru, users get a token that never expires
    - Tokens should expire and must require you to log in regularly to keep it secure
- A valid token allowed any service request
    - Even adding your email address to someone else's account
    - Allows you to have full access into someone else's car
- Web front-end included an XSS vulnerability
    - A user clicks a malicious link, and now you have their token

#### Protecting Against XSS
- Don't click untrusted links
    - Never blindly click in your email inbox
- Consider disabling JS
    - Control it with an extension
- Keep browser and applications updated
    - Avoid nasty browser vulnerabilities
