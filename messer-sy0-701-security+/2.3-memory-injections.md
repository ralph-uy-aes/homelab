# 2.3 Memory Injections

#### Finding Malware
- Malware runs in memory
    - Memory forensics can find the malicious code
- Memory contains running processes
    - DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries)
    - Threads
    - Buffers
    - Memory management functions
    - More...
- Malware is hidden somewhere
    - Runs its own process
    - Injects itself into a legitimate process

#### Memory Injection
- Processes have a starting address and ending address
    - Malware is injected in between the two addresses
- Avoid detection
- Get access to the data in that process
- Get same rights and permissions
- Perform privilege escalation

#### DLL Injection
- Dynamic Link Library
    - A windows library containing code and data
    - Many applications can use this library
- Attackers inject a path to a malicious DLL
    - Runs as part of the target process
- One of the most popular memory injection methods
    - Relatively easy to implement
- As memory runs, a call to the malicious DLL is injected into a process
    - Once the memory reaches the point where it has to call the DLL, the malware runs
