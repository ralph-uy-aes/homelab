# 1.4 Hashing and Digital Signatures

#### Hashes
- Represent data as a short string of text
    - A message digest, fingerprint, etc...
- One-way trip
    - Impossible to recreate the message from the digest
    - You can't recreate a person from a fingerprint
    - Used to store passwords / confidentiality
- Verify that a downloaded document is the same as the original
    - Integrity
- Can be a digital signature
    - Authentication, non-repudiation, integrity

#### Hash Example
- SHA256 Hash
    - 256 bits of information represented as 64 hexadecimal characters
- "My name is Patrick"
    - 2139ae8f9b9918cd....
- "My name is Patrock"
    - ad38418ecb123013....
- Changing one letter changes the entire hash, proof of integrity

#### Collision
- Hash Functions
    - Takes an input of any size
    - Creates a fixed size string
    - Message digest, checksum
- Hashes should be unique
    - Different inputs should never create the same hash
    - If they do, it's a collision
- MD5 has a collision problem
    - Found in 1996
    - Don't use MD5 for anything important

#### Practical Hashing
- Verify a downloaded file
- Hashes may be provided on the download site
- Compare the downloaded file hash with the posted hash value
- Password Storage
    - Instead of storing the password, store a salted hash
    - Compare hashes during the authentication process
    - Nobody ever knows your actual password

#### Adding Some Salt
- Salt
    - Random data added to a password when hashing
    - Modifies or randomizes the resulting hash
- Every user gets their own random salt
    - Commonly stored with the password
- Rainbow Tables
    - Technique for reverse-engineering hashes
    - Precompiled set for every possible input and a series of hashes for each input
    - Easy for non-salted hashes
    - Impossible to work with salted hashes
- Slows downs the brute-force process
    - Doesn't completely stop the reverse engineering

#### Salting the Hash
- Each user gets a different random hash
    - Same password + different salt = a different hash
- Ex.
    - "dragon": abed183c00e19...
    - "dragon" + "gsEVx": 31289bced01a...
    - "dragon" + "H3qRT": 1931fabce01...

#### Digital Signatures
- Prove the message was not changed to show integrity
- Prove the source of the message to show authenticity
- Prove the signature isn't fake to show non-repudiation
- Sign with the private key
    - Message doesn't need to be encrypted
    - Nobody else can sign this
- Verify with public key
    - Any change in the message will invalidate the signature

#### Creating a Digital Signature
- Alice wants to send a plaintext to Bob
- Alice sends the plaintext and it hashes automatically
- The hashed plaintext is encrypted with Alice's private key
- This hashed and encrypted plaintext is now the digital signature and it is sent attached to the original plaintext to Bob
- Bob receives the plaintext + the digital signature
- Bob decrypts the digital signature using Alice's public key to get the hash
- Bob hashes the plaintext and compares it to the decrypted hash to validate
