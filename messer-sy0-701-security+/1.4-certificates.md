# 1.4 Certificates

#### Digital Certificates
- Public key certificate
    - Contains both a public key and a digital signature
    - Kind of like a digital ID card
- Digital signatures add trust
    - PKI uses CAs for additional trust
        - If CA trusts person's digital certificate, then we should also trust that person
    - Web of Trust adds other users for additional trust
        - Instead of having a centralized CA, decentralized nodes sign on each other
        - If our friend trusts a third-party, we probably can too
- Certificate creation can be built into the OS
    - Part of Windows Domain services
    - Many 3rd-party options

#### What's in a Digital Certificate
- X.509
    - Standardized format for digital certificates
- Certificate details
    - Serial number
    - Version
    - Signature algorithm
    - Issuer
    - Name of the cert holder
    - Public key
    - Extensions
    - And more...

#### Root of Trust
- Everything associated with IT security requires trust, a foundational characteristic
- How to build trust from something unknown?
    - Someone or something trustworthy provides their approval
- Refer to the root of trust
    - An inherently trusted component
    - Hardware, software, firmware, other component
    - Hardware Security Modules (HSM), Secure Enclave, Certificate Authority, etc...

#### Certificate Authorities
- You connect to a random website, do you trust it?
- A trusted third-party or an authority is needed
- CA has digitally signed the website certificate
    - You trust the CA, the CA trusts the website, you trust the website
    - Real-time validation that the website is trustworthy

#### Third-party Certificate Authorities
- Built-in to your browser
- Hundreds of CAs are used by browsers
    - Websites can buy a certificate from any of these CAs and be put in their trust list
- CA is responsible for vetting the request
    - Sites pay for the validation process, no the certificate itself (could be denied a certificate if CA deems untrustworthy)
    - Confirm the certificate owner
    - Additional verification information may be required by the CA

#### Certificate Signing Requests
- Create a key pair, then send the public key to the CA to be signed
    - Certificate Signing Request (CSR)
- Applicant creates a digital certificate using their public key
- Applicant adds identifying information to their digital certificate to create a CSR
    - Identifying information just contains details about organization, owner, etc...
- Applicant sends CSR to CA
- CA validates the applicant's identity
- CA uses their private key to sign the validated certificate and sends it back to applicant

#### Private Certificate Authorities
- You are your own CA
    - Homemade
    - Devices must trust the internal CA
- Install a CA software inside the organization
- Take public certificate from CA and install it in each device in the organization
- Needed for medium to large organizations
    - Many web servers and privacy requirements
- Implement as part of your overall computing strategy
    - Windows Certificate Services, OpenCA

#### Self-signed Certificates
- Internal certificates don't need to be signed by a public CA
    - Your company is the only one going to use it
    - No need to purchase trust for devices that already trust you
- Build your own CA
    - Issue your own certificates signed by your own CA
- Install the CA certificate / trusted chain on all devices
    - They'll now trust any certificates signed by your internal CA
    - Works exactly like a certificate you purchased

#### Wildcard Certificates
- Subject Alternative Name (SAN)
    - Extension to an X.509 certificate
    - Lists additional identification information
    - Allows a certificate to support many different domains
- Wildcard domain
    - Certificates are based on the name of the server
    - Wildcard domain will apply to all server names in a domain

#### Key Revocation
- Removing certificates because of updates or compromise
- Certificate Revocation List (CRL)
    - Maintained by CA
    - Can contain many revocations in a large file
- April 2014 - CVE-2014-0160
    - Heartbleed
    - OpenSSL flaw put the private key of affected web servers at risk
    - OpenSSL was patched, every web server certificate was replaced
    - Older certificates were moved to the CRL
- As long as a certificate is not in the CRL, operations can continue

#### Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) Stapling
- Provides scalability for OCSP checks
- The CA is responsible for responding to all client OCSP requests which does not scale well
- Instead, have the certificate holder verify their own status
    - Status information is stored on the certificate holder's server
- OCSP status is stapled into the SSL/TLS handshake
    - Digitally signed by the CA to validate its status

#### Getting Revocation Details to the Browser
- Messages usually sent to an OCSP responder via HTTP
    - Easy to support over internet links
    - More efficient than downloading a CRL
- Not all browsers or apps support OCSP
    - Early Internet Explorer versions did not support OCSP
- Some support OCSP, but don't bother checking
