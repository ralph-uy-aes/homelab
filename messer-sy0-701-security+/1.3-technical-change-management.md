# 1.3 Technical Change Management

#### Technical Change Management
- Putting change management into action
    - Actually executing it
- No such thing as a simple upgrade
    - Many moving parts
    - Separate events may be required
- Change management is often concerned with what needs to change
    - Technical team is concerned with how to change it

#### Allow or Deny List
- Any application can be dangerous
    - Vulnerabilities, trojan horses, malware
- Security policy can control app execution
    - Allow list, deny/block list
- Allow list
    - Nothing runs unless approved
    - Very restrictive
- Deny list
    - Nothing on the bad list can be executed
    - Anti-virus, anti-malware are very big deny lists

#### Restricted Activities
- Scope of a change is important
    - Defines exactly which components are covered
- A change approval isn't permission to make any change
    - If you're given a change time window, you can only update whatever's in the scope
- The scope may need to be expanded during the change window
    - It's impossible to prepare for all possible outcomes
- Change management process determines the next steps

#### Downtime
- Services will probably be unavailable
    - Change process can be disruptive 
    - Usually scheduled during non-production hours like overnight
- If possible, prevent any downtime
    - Switch to secondary system, upgrade the primary, then switch back
- Minimize any downtime events
    - Process should be as automated as possible
    - Switch back to secondary system if issues appear
    - Should be part of the backout plan
- Send emails and calendar updates regarding downtime

#### Restarts
- Commonly required following a change
    - Implement the new configuration
    - Reboot the OS, power cycle the switch, bounce the service
    - Helps to understand if the system can recover from a power outage
- Services
    - May only require to stop and restart the service or daemon
    - May take seconds or minutes
- Application or executable
    - Close application completely, launch a new instance

#### Legacy Applications
- Some applications will be there before you arrived and will remain long after you're gone
- Often no longer supported by the developer
    - Support is now individual (you)
- No one in the organization understands how to support the system
    - Fear of the unknown
    - Can be solved by documenting the system 
    - Not as bad as you think
- May be quirky
    - Weird OS or code
- You can become an expert of this system

#### Dependencies
- You need to change A before you can install or update B
    - A service will not start without other active services
    - An application requires a specific library version
- Modifying one component may require changing or restarting other components
    - Challenging to manage

#### Documentation
- Challenging to keep up with changes
    - Documentation can be outdated very quickly
    - Require it with the change management process
- Updating diagrams or charts
    - Modify network configs
    - Address updates
- Updating policies or procedures
    - New systems may require this

#### Version Control
- Track changes to a file or configuration data over time
    - Easily revert to a previous setting
- Many opportunities to manage versions
    - Router configs
    - Windows OS patches
    - Application registry entries
- Not always straightforward
    - Some devices and operating systems provide version control features
    - May require additional third-party management software
