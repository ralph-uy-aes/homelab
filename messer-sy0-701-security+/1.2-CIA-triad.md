# 1.2 CIA Triad

#### The CIA Triad
- Combination of principles
    - Fundamentals of security
    - Sometimes referenced as the AIC Triad
- Confidentiality
    - Prevent disclosure of information to unauthorized individuals to systems
- Integrity
    - Make sure the recipient is sent exactly what the sender is trying to send
    - Messages can't be modified without detection
- Availability
    - Systems and networks must be up and running at all times
    - Even during updates

#### Confidentiality
- Certain information should only be known to certain people
    - Prevent unauthorized disclosure
- Encryption
    - Encode messages so only certain people can read it
    - One person encrypts data and sends it to someone else
        - Other person can decrypt
    - Anyone in the middle cannot decrypt
- Access Controls
    - Limits to who has access to what
    - Selectively restrict access to a resource
- Two-Factor Authentication
    - Additional confirmation before information is disclosed
    - Means more confidentiality

#### Integrity
- Data is stored and transferred as intended
    - Any modification to the data would be identified
- Hashing
    - Person sending the data sends a hash with the data
    - The receiver creates a hash of the data and if it matches the hash attached to the data, then the data is the same
- Digital Signature
    - Mathematical scheme to verify the integrity of data
    - Check to make sure that none of the data has changed
    - Important for sensitive data
- Certificates
    - Combine with a digital signature to verify an individual
    - Identifies devices or people
- Non-repudiation
    - Proof of integrity
    - Confirm without a doubt that the information received comes from originating party

#### Availability
- Information is accessible to authorized users
    - Always at your fingertips
- Redundancy
    - Build services that will always be available
- Fault Tolerance
    - System continues to run even during failure
- Patching
    - Updating systems ensures stability and closes security holes
