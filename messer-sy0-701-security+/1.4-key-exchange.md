# 1.4 Key Exchange

#### Key Exchange
- A logistical challenge
    - How do you share an encryption key across an insecure medium without physically handing it
- Out-of-band key exchange
    - Don't send it over the internet
    - Telephone, courier, in-person, etc...
- In-band key exchange
    - On the internet
    - Protect the key with additional encryption
    - Use asymmetric encryption to deliver a symmetric key for example

#### Real-time Encryption/Decryption
- There's a need for fast security
    - Without compromising the security part
- Share a symmetric session key using asymmetric encryption
    - Client encrypts a random symmetric key with a server's public key
    - Server decrypts this shared key and uses it to encrypt data
    - This is the session key
- Implement session keys carefully
    - They're ephemeral (change often)
    - They're unpredictable

#### Symmetric Key from Asymmetric Keys
- Use public and private key cryptography to create a symmetric key
- Bob has private key
- Alice also has a private key
- Bob's private key is combined with Alice's public key
- Alice's private key is combined with Bob's public key
- They have mathematically related keys now 
    - These two keys are the same and are considered symmetric keys
    - Something to note is that this symmetric key wasn't even sent over the network, they just used each other's asymmetric keys
