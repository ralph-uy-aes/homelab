# 1.2 Gap Analysis

#### Gap Analysis
- The gap between where you are vs where you want to be
- Relatively complex process and requires extensive research
    - Can take weeks or months
    - Extensive study with multiple participants
    - Get ready for emails, data gathering, and technical research

#### Choosing the Framework
- Work towards a known baseline
    - May be an internal set of goals
- Determine an end goal
    - NIST CSF 2.0
    - NIST Special Publication 800-171 Revision 2, Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Systems and Organizations
    - ISO/IEC 27001, Information Security Management Systems

#### Evaluate People and Processes
- Get a baseline of employees
    - Formal experience
    - Current training
    - Knowledge of security policies and procedures
- Examine the current processes
    - Research existing IT systems
    - Evaluate existing policies

#### Compare and Contrast
- Evaluate existing systems
- Identify weaknesses along with most effective processes
- A detailed analysis
    - Examine broad security categories
    - Break those into smaller segments

#### Analysis and Report
- Final comparison
    - Detailed baseline objectives
    - A clear view of the current state vs where we would want to be
- Need a path to get from current to target
    - Takes time, money, and changes of controls
- Create the gap analysis report
    - Formal description of the current state
    - Recommendations for meeting the baseline
