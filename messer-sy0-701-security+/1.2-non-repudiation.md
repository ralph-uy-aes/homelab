# 1.2 Non-Repudiation

#### Non-Repudiation
- You can't deny what you said, no taking it back
- Third parties are able to verify that any information is sent exactly from a sender
- Signing a contract
    - Signature adds non-repudiation
    - You really did sign the contract
- Cryptography
    - Proof of integrity
    - Proof of origin
    - Assures authenticity

#### Proof of Integrity
- Verify data does not change
    - Data remains accurate and consistent
    - Nothing inside of the data has been altered
- Cryptography uses hashes
    - Short string of text representing the data
    - A message digest or a fingerprint
- If the data changes, so does the hash
    - If the person changes, the fingerprint changes
- Hashes are only good for telling you if something has been altered
    - Doesn't tell you who sent the data

#### Hashing the Encyclopedia
- Project Gutenberg's Gutenberg Encyclopedia is 8.1 megabytes
    - Hashed by an application into a string of characters (numbers and letters)
- Changing one character changes the entire hash
    - A needle in a haystack changes the entire haystack
- If the hash is different, something changed
    - Data integrity compromised (intentionally or otherwise)

#### Proof of Origin
- Prove the source of the message (Authentication)
- Make sure the signature isn't fake (Non-repudiation)
- Sign with the private key
    - Message doesn't need to be encrypted
    - Nobody else can sign this private key
- Verify the private key with the public key
    - Any change to the message will invalidate the signature

#### Creating a Digital Signature
- Alice wants to send a message to Bob and sign it
- Hashing algorithm creates a hash of the message
- Alice encrypts the hash of the message with her private key
- Alice sends the encrypted hash attached to the message to Bob

#### Verifying a Digital Signature
- Bob receives the message with the encrypted hash
- Bob uses Alice's public key and decrypts the encrypted hash
- Bob now has the original hash of the message
- Bob hashes the message sent with the same hashing algorithm and matches it to the decrypted hash
- Now, Bob knows the message wasn't altered and it came from Alice
