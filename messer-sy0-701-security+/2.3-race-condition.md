# 2.3 Race Condition

#### Race Condition
- A programming conundrum
    - Sometimes, things happen at the same time
    - Can be bad if not planned for
- Time of check to time of use attack (TOCTOU)
    - Check the system
    - When do you use the results of your last check
    - Something might happen between time of check and time of use
        - Values change and race condition occurs

#### Real-world
