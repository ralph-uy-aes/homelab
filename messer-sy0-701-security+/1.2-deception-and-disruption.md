- Observe what techniques they try to use to break in
- Oftentimes bad guys are probably a machine or automated process
    - See what type of automation is being used
    - What type of systems are they attacking
- Create a virtual and fake world to explore
- Different options allow you to make your own honeypot
- Constant battle to discern the real from the fake
    - Attackers want to know if they're in a honeypot or a real system

#### Honeynets
- Can consist of servers, workstations, routers, switches, firewalls
    - Makes it look more real
- A larger deception network with one or more honeypots

#### Honeyfiles
- Files with fake information that seem to be very important
- Baits attackers to files like `password.txt`
    - Use a lot of baits in file shares
- An alert is sent whenever files are accessed
- Virtual bear trap

#### Honeytokens
- Traceable data added to honeynets to track malicious actors
- If the data is stolen and distributed, you know exactly where it came from
- API Credentials out on a public cloud share
    - Whoever steals these made up API credentials can be tracked
- Fake email addresses
    - Add to a contact list
    - Monitor the internet to see who posts it
- Other honeytokens
    - Database records, browser cookies, web page pixels
