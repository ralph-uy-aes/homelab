# 2.3 Buffer Overflows

#### Buffer Overflows
- Overwriting a buffer of memory
- Spills over into other memory areas
- Developers need to perform bounds checking
    - Anyone writing into a section of memory can only write that many bytes specified
    - Attackers spend a lot of time looking for openings
- Not a simple exploit
    - Takes time to avoid crashing things
    - Takes time to make it do what you want
- A really useful buffer overflow is repeatable which means that a system can be compromised
