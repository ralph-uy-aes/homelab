# 2.3 Virtualization Vulnerabilities

#### Virtualization Security
- Quite different from non-virtual machines
    - Can appear anywhere
- Cloud environments often have many creation and destruction of virtual machines
- Quantity of resources vary between VMs
    - CPU, memory, storage
- Many similarities to physical machines
    - Complexity adds opportunity for attackers
- Virtualization vulnerabilities
    - Local privilege escalation
    - Command injection
    - Information disclosure
- VMs must be protected much like a real machine

#### VM Escape Protection
- Virtual machines are self-contained
    - But is it possible to move from one hypervisor to another or escape it entirely?
- VM escape
    - Break out of the VM and interact with the host OS or hardware or other hypervisors
- Once you escape the VM, you have great control
    - Control the host, control the other guest VMs
- Huge exploit, full control of the virtual world

#### Escaping the VM
- March 2017 - Pwn2Own Competition
    - JS engine bug in MS Edge
    - Code execution in the Edge sandbox
    - Discovered Windows 10 kernel bug, compromising the guest OS
    - Hardware simulation bug in VMWare, escaped to the host
    - VMWare rolled out patches soon after

#### Resource Reuse
- Hypervisor manages the relationship between physical and virtual resources
    - Available RAM, storage space, CPU availability, etc...
- Resources can be reused between VMs
    - Hypervisor host with 4 GB of RAM
    - Supports 3 VMs with 2 GB of RAM each
    - RAM is allocated and shared between VMs
- Data cna inadvertently be shared between VMs
    - If a hypervisor has a bug, one VM could write to one memory area which is then read by another VM
    - Time to update the memory management features
    - Security patches can mitigate the risk
