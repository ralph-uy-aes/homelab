# 2.3 Operating System Vulnerabilities

#### Operating Systems
- A foundational computing platform
    - Everyone has an OS, so it's a big target
- Remarkably complex
    - Millions of lines of code
    - More code means more opportunities for a security issue
- The vulnerabilities are already in there, just haven't been found yet

#### A Mont of OS Updates
- Patch Tuesday - 2nd Tuesday every month
    - Windows updates
    - Other companies have similar scehdules
- May 9, 2023
    - Microsoft released near 50 security patches
    - 8 elevation of privilege vuln.
    - 4 security feature bypass vuln.
    - 12 remote code execute vuln.
    - 8 information disclosure vuln.
    - 5 denial of service vuln.
    - 1 spoofing vuln.

#### Best Practices for OS Vulnerabilities
- Always update
    - Monthly or on-demand updates
    - It's a race between you and attackers
- May require testing before deployment
    - A patch might break something else
- May require a reboot
    - Save all data
- Have a fallback plan
