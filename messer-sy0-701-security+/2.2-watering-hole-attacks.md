# Watering Hole Attacks

#### Watering Hole Attack
- What if your network was really secure?
    - You didn't plug in that USB key from the parking
    - Employees are well-trained
- The attackers can't get in
    - Employees don't respond to phishing emails
    - Attachments aren't opened
- Attackers have the mountain come to you
    - Go where the company gets their water from and poison the source
    - Requires a bit of research

#### Executing the Watering Hole Attack
- Determine which third-party website the victim group uses
- Educated guess - local coffee or sandwich shop
    - Attackers infect that, then escalate into your company
    - Industry-related sites
- Infect one of these third-party sites
    - Site vulnerability
    - Email attachments
- Infect all visitors
    - But are looking for specific victims

#### Real-world
- January 2017
- Polish Financial Supervision Authority, National Banking and Stock Commission of Mexico, State-owned bank in Uruguay
- Visiting the site would download malicious JS files
    - But only to specific IP addresses matching banks and other financial institutions
