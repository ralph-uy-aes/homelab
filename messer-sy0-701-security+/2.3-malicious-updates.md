- Follow best practices
    - Always have a known-good backup
    - Install from trusted sources
    - Backups

#### Downloading and Updating
- Install updates from a downloaded file
- Always consider your actions, every install could be malicious
- Confirm the source
    - A random pop-up during web browsing may not be legitimate

    - Don't disable your security controls

#### Automatic Updates

    - Include security checks and digital signatures
- Trustworthy as it comes directly from the developer
- Not a 100% guaranteed secure process
