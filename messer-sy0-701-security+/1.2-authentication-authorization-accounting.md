# 1.2 Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting

#### AAA Framework
- Login process:
    - Identification
        - Who you claim to be
        - Usually your username
    - Authentication
        - Prove you are who you claim to be
        - Password, MFA, etc...
    - Authorization
        - Based on your identification and authentication, what access do you have
        - Are you a user or admin? or something else?
    - Accounting
        - Log every resource used
        - Login time, data sent and received, logout time

#### Authenticating People
- Logging into a VPN server
    - Starting with a client that wants to access an internal file server
- Client sends username and password over the internet to a Firewall or VPN Concentrator
    - VPN Concentrator doesn't have anything to validate credentials, so it forwards the data sent to a AAA server
- AAA Server checks if records exist and match
    - If they do, an approval is relayed to the VPN Concentrator
- VPN Concentrator grants access to the internal file server

#### Authenticating SYstems
- You have to manage many devices
- A system can't type a password and you may not want to store one
- How can you authenticate a headless device?
    - Put a digitally signed certificate on the device
- Other business processes rely on the certificate
    - Access to the VPN from authorized devices
    - Management software can validate the end device

#### Certificate Authentication
- An organization has a trusted Certificate Authority (CA)
    - Device or software that manages certificates
- The organization creates a certificate for a device
    - Digitally signs the certificate with the organization's CA
- Certificate can now be included on a device as an authentication factor
    - CA's digital signature is used to verify the certificate

#### Certificate-based Authentication
- Imagine a laptop that has a signed CA certificate and a CA with a root authority
- CA checks if its digital signature matches that of the laptop's and grants access if they do

#### Authorization Models
- Now that the user or device has been authenticated what do they have access to?
- Authorization models are used to authorize users and services to access data and applications
    - How do you create this relationship to scale with a larger user base?
- Associating individual users to access rights does not scale
- Many environments accomplish this by taking the users and services and putting an authorization model between them prior to accessing data
    - Defined by roles, organizations, attributes, etc...

#### No Authorization Model
- A simple relationship
    - User -> Resource
- Problems
    - Does not scale very well
    - Difficult to understand why an authorization may exist
- Hard to understand why different employees may have access to different data as opposed to creating an abstraction

#### Using an Authorization Model
- Add an abstraction
    - Reduce complexity
    - Create a clear relationship between the user and the resource
- Administration is streamlined
    - Easy to understand the authorizations
    - Support any number of users or resources
- Now, you can categorize a bunch of employees under "Shipping and Receiving Team" and give that category access to various data (instead of giving it to each employee one by one)
