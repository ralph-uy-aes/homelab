# 2.3 Supply Chain Vulnerabilities

#### Supply Chain Risk
- Chain contains many moving parts
- Security is concerned with every step of the supply chain
- Anywhere along this path, attacker can infect the chain
    - People trust their suppliers, no suspicion
- One exploit can infect the entire chain

#### Service Providers
- You can control your own security posture
    - But what if you're outsourcing to a third-party
    - Service providers controls their own security posture
- Service providers have access to internal services
    - Larger attack surface for attackers
- This is why security audits are common with service providers
    - Usually built into the contract

#### Target Service Provider Attack
- Target was breached on November 2013
- 40 million credit cards stolen
    - Infected 1,800 stores
- Heating and AC firm in Pennsylvania was infected
    - Malware delivered via email
    - HVAC was a Target supplier
- HVAC vendor had access to the Target network which also had the Target cash register network
    - HVAC vendor -> Target network -> Cash register network

#### Hardware Providers
- Can you trust your new server/router/switch/firewall/software
- Use a small supplier base
    - Tighter control of vendors
- Strict controls over policies and procedures
    - Ensure proper security is in place
- Security should be part of the overall design
    - There's a limit to trust
- Treat all devices like they have security vulnerabilities

#### Cisco or not Cisco?
- All network traffic flows through switches and routers
- Became a problem on July 2022 - DHS arrests Cisco reseller CEO
    - Sold more than $1 Billion worth of counterfeit Cisco products
    - Created over 30 different companies to resell
    - Had been selling since 2013
- Knock-offs were made in China
    - Sold as authentic Cisco products
    - Until they started breaking and catching on fire

#### Software Providers
- Trust is a foundation of security
- Every software installation questions our trust
- Initial installation
    - Look at the digital signature, make sure it's validated
- Updates and patches
    - Some updates are automatic
    - You really need to trust the update, anything can be installed
- Open source is not immune either
    - Some people can compromise the source code itself

#### SolarWinds Supply Chain Attack
- SolarWinds Orion
    - Used by 18,000 customers
    - Including Fortune 500 and US Federal Government
- Software updates compromised in March and June 2020
    - Upgrades to existing installations
    - Not detected until December 2020
- Additional breaches took advantage of the exploit
    - Microsoft, Cisco, Intel, Deloitte, Pentagon, Homeland Security, etc.
