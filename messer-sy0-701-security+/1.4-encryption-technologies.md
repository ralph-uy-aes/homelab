# 1.4 Encryption Technologies

#### Trusted Platform Module (TPM)
- Standardized hardware found on motherboards
- Specifies cryptographic functions
    - Cryptographic hardware on device
- Cryptographic processor
    - Random number generator, key generator
- Persistent memory
    - Unique keys burned in during manufacturing
- Versatile memory
    - Storage keys, hardware configuration information
    - Securely store BitLocker keys
- Password protected
    - No dictionary attacks for information stored in TPM

#### Hardware Security Module (HSM)
- Used in large environments
    - Clusters redundant power
- Securely stores thousands of cryptographic keys
    - Imagine a thousand web servers in an organization, all needing keys
    - HSM provides a secure storage for all server keys
- High-end cryptographic hardware
    - Plug-in card or separate hardware device
- Key backup
    - Secure storage in hardware
    - Prevents unauthorized access
- Cryptographic accelerators
    - Offload CPU overhead from other devices
- Has and needs redundancies

#### Key Management System
- Services are everywhere
    - On-premises, cloud-based
    - Many different keys for many different services
- Manages all keys from a centralized manager
    - Often provided as third-party software
    - Separates encryption keys from data
- All key management from one console
    - Create keys for a specific service or cloud provider for SSL/TLS, SSH, etc...
    - Associate keys with specific users
    - Rotate keys regularly
    - Log key use and important events

#### Keeping Data Private
- Our data is located in many different places
    - Mobile phones, cloud, laptops, etc...
    - The most private data is often physically closest to us
- Attackers always find new techniques
    - It's an arms race to stay one step ahead
- Our data is constantly changing
    - How do we keep this data protected?

#### Secure Enclave
- A protected area for our secrets
    - Often implemented as a hardware processor
    - Isolated from the main processor
- Provides extensive security features
    - Has its own boot ROM
    - Monitors the system boot process
    - True random number generator
    - Real-time memory encryption
    - Root cryptographic keys
    - Performs AES encryption in hardware
    - And more!
