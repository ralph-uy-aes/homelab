# 2.2 Common Threat Vectors

#### Threat Vectors
- AKA Attack Vector
- A method used by the attacker to gain access or infect the target
- Lot of work goes into finding vulnerabilities in these vectors
    - Some more vulnerable than others
- IT security professionals spend their career watching these vectors
    - Protect existing vectors
    - Find new vectors

#### Message-based Vectors
- One of the most successful threat vectors
    - Everyone has at least one of these messaging systems
- Email
    - Malicious links
    - Malware attachments
- SMS (Short Message Service)
    - Attacks in a text message
    - Direct communication with attackers
- Phishing Attacks
    - People want to click links
    - Links in an email, text, etc...
    - Decoy sites that ask for sensitive information or credentials
- Deliver malware to the user
    - Attached to the email
    - Scan all attachments, never launch untrusted links
- Social Engineering Attacks
    - Invoice scams
    - Cryptocurrency scams
    - Facebook Marketplace scams

#### Image-based Vectors
- Easy to identify text-based threats
    - More difficult to identify the threat in an image
- Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG)
    - Described in XML (Extensible Markup Language)
    - Allows you to embed more things in the XML
    - Security concerns
        - HTML Injection
        - Javascript attack code
- Browsers allow input validation to avoid running malicious code in SVG
    - Most browsers do this, unless the browser has vulnerabilities

#### File-based Vectors
- More than just .exe
    - Malicious code can be hidden in many places
- Adobe PDF
    - File format containing other objects
- ZIP/RAR files (compression files)
    - Contains many different files that could be malicious
- Microsoft Office
    - Documents with macros
    - Add-in files
    - Extensions

#### Voice Call Vectors
- Vishing
    - Phishing over the phone
- Spam over IP
    - Large-scale phone calls
- War dialing
    - Unpublished phone numbers that may gain attackers access to systems
- Call tampering
    - Disrupting voice calls
    - DDoS

#### Removable Device Vectors
- Get around thousand dollar firewalls using one dollar flash drives
    - USB interface
- Malicious software on flash drives
    - Infect air gapped networks
    - Industrial systems, high-security services
- USB devices can act as keyboards
    - Hacker on a chip
    - Appear as keyboard device
- Data exfiltration
    - Terabytes of data can walk out the door
    - Zero bandwidth used

#### Vulnerable Software Vectors
- Client-based
    - Infected executable
    - Known or unknown vulnerabilities
    - May require constant updates
- Agentless
    - No installed executable
    - Compromised software on the server would affect all users
    - Client runs a new instance each time

#### Unsupported Systems Vectors
- Patching is an important prevention tool
- Unsupported systems aren't patched
    - May not be patchable
- Outdated operating systems
    - Manufacturer has moved on, you haven't
- A single system could be an entry
    - Keep inventory and records updated

#### Unsecure Network Vectors
- Network connects everything
    - Ease of access for attackers
    - View all non-encrypted data
- Wireless
    - Outdated security protocols (WEP, WPA, WPA2)
    - Open or rogue wireless networks
- Wired
    - Unsecure interfaces - No 802.1X
- Bluetooth
    - Reconnaissance
    - Implementation vulnerabilities

#### Open Service Ports
- Most network-based services connect over a TCP or UDP port
    - Open ports
- Every open port is an opportunity for the attacker
- Application vulnerability or misconfiguration
- Every application has their own open port
    - More services expand the attack surface
    - More services = less security
- Firewall rules
    - Must allow traffic to open port
    - Limits access, limits attack vectors

#### Default Credentials
- Most devices have default usernames and passwords
    - Username: admin/user/root
    - Password: admin/password/root
- Change default
- Very easy to find details for access points or routers
    - https://www.routerpasswords.com

#### Supply Chain Vectors
- Tamper with the underlying infrastructure or manufacturing process
- Managed Service Providers (MSPs)
    - Access many different customer networks from one location
    - Access to MSP = Access to customers
- Gain access to network using a vendor
    - 2013 Target credit card breach
- Suppliers
    - Counterfeit networking equipment
    - Install backdoors, substandard performance and availability
    - 2020 - Fake Cisco Catalyst switches
