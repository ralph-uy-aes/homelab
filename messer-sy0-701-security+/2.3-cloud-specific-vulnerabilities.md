# 2.3 Cloud-Specific Vulnerabilities

#### Security in the Cloud
- Every organization likely has one or more application in the cloud
- We've put sensitive data in the cloud, attackers want this data
- We're not putting the right protections
    - 76% of organizations aren't using MFA for management console users
- Simple best-practices aren't being used
    - 63% of code in production is unpatched
    - Vulnerabilities rated high or critical, CVSS >= 7.0

#### Attack the Service
- Anyone in the world can attack applications within a public cloud
- Applications are subject to:
    - DDoS or DoS
    - Authentication bypass
        - Take advantage of weak or faulty authentication
    - Directory traversal
        - Faulty configurations put data at risk
        - Anyone can go through files and folders
    - Remote code execution
        - Take advantage of unpatched systems
        - Any application can be run on the cloud based-systems by anyone
    - Web application attacks have increased
        - Log4j and Spring Cloud Function
        - Easy to exploit, lots of rewards
    - Cross-site scripting
        - Take advantage of poor input validation
    - Out of bounds write
        - Write to unauthorized memory areas
        - Data corruption, crashing, code execution
        - Buffer Overflow
    - SQL Injection
        - Grant direct access to the database
