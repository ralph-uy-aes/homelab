# 1.2 Zero Trust

#### Zero Trust
- Once you're through a firewall, the inside of a network is relatively open
    - There are few security controls
    - Allows authorized individuals and unauthorized individuals or malicious software to go anywhere they want
- As a response to this, many networks are being changed to be zero trust, as a holistic approach
    - You need to prove your authentication for every access attempt
    - Applies to every device, process, and person
- Everything must be verified, nothing is trusted
    - MFA, encryption, system permissions, additional firewalls, monitoring and analytics, etc...

#### Planes of Operation
- Split the network into functional planes
    - Physical, virtual, cloud planes
- Data Plane
    - Could be a switch, router, firewall
    - Process the frames, packets, and networking data
    - Handles processing, forwarding, trunking, encrypting, NAT
- Control Plane
    - Manages actions of the data plane
    - Define policies and rules
    - Determine how packets should be forwarded
    - Routing tables, session tables, NAT tables

#### Extend the Physical Architecture
- Separate into functional tasks
    - Incorporate into hardware or software

#### Controlling Trust
- Adaptive identity
    - Consider the source and the requested resources
    - Examine multiple risk indicators
        - Relationship to organization, physical location, type of connection, IP address, etc
    - Make authentication stronger if needed
    - Imagine an employee of a US company trying to login from China
- Threat scope reduction
    - Limit possible entry points to something
    - Like using a VPN server, removing a login interface, etc...
    - Imagine a castle's moat
- Policy-driven access control
    - Combine the adaptive identity with a predefined set of rules
    - What type of authentication process should be used

#### Security Zones
- Security is more than a one-to-one relationship
    - Broad categorizations provide a security-related foundation
- Where are you coming from and where are you going
    - Trusted, untrusted
    - Internal vs external network
    - VPN 1, VPN 5, VPN 11
    - Marketing, IT, Accounting, HR
- Use the zones to deny access
    - Blocking untrusted traffic from getting into trusted zone traffic
- Some zones are implicitly trusted
    - Trusted zone traffic can get into Internal zone traffic

#### Policy Enforcement Point
- Subjects and systems
    - End users, applications, non-human entities
- Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)
    - Acts like a gatekeeper
    - Decides if traffic is allowed or not
- Allow, monitor, and terminate connections
    - Can consist of multiple components working together to authenticate

#### Applying Trust in the Planes
- Policy Decision Point
    - Process for making an authentication decision
- Policy Engine
    - Evaluates each access decision based on policy and other information sources
    - Grant, deny, or revoke
- Policy Administrator
    - Communicates with Policy Enforcement Point
    - Generates access tokens or credentials
    - Tells PEP to allow or disallow access
