# 1.4 Blockchain Technology

#### Blockchain
- A distributed ledger
    - Keeps track of transactions
- Everyone on the blockchain network maintains the ledger
    - Records and replicates to anyone and everyone
- Many practical applications
    - Payment processing
    - Digital identification
    - Supply chain monitoring
    - Digital voting

#### Blockchain Process
- A transaction is requested
- The transaction could be any digital transaction from transferring Bitcoins, medical records, data backups, house title, etc...
- The results of the transaction is sent to everyone in a decentralized network
    - Everyone gets a copy of the transaction
- The transaction is added into a larger block of transactions containing previously verified transactions
- To complete the block, a hash is added to it
    - A hash is calculated from the previous blocks of transaction data in the Blockchain
    - Each hash is unique to its block as it is computed from the transactions in that block
- A copy of the block is sent to everyone with a copy of the blockchain's ledger
    - If someone tries to alter a transaction in the block, the hash also changes and is no longer valid
    - Other devices also pick up on this invalidity
        - Altered chain does not match chains stored by the rest of the network and is rejected
