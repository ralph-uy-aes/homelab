# 1.3 Change Management

#### Change Management
- How to make a change
    - Upgrade software, patch an application, change firewall config, modify switch ports, etc...
- One of the most common risks in the enterprise and occurs very frequently
- Less updates = less security
- Create a formal process to making updates
    - If anyone can update anything, problems occur
    - Have clear policies
        - Frequency, duration, installation process, rollback procedures
- Sometimes extremely difficult to implement
    - Hard to change corporate culture

#### Change Approval Process
- A formal process for managing change
    - Inform everyone, avoid downtime, confusion, and mistakes
- A typical approval process
    - Complete the request forms
    - Determine the purpose of the change
    - Identify the scope of the change
    - Schedule a date and time of the change
    - Determine affected systems and its impact
    - Analyze risk associated with the change
    - Get approval from the change control board
    - Get end-user acceptance after the change is complete

#### Ownership
- Individual or entity needs to make a change
    - Own the process
    - Not usually the ones to perform the actual change
- Owners manage the process
    - Updates are provided to the owner
    - Ensures the process is followed and acceptable
- Address label printers need to be upgraded
    - Shipping and Receiving Team owns the process
    - IT handles the actual change to the printing software

#### Stakeholders
- Who is impacted by this change
    - Want to have input on the process
- Not as obvious as you think
    - Single change can include one stakeholder or the entire company
- Upgrade software used for shipping labels
    - Affects:
        - Shipping and Receiving Team
        - Accounting Reports (Accounting)
        - Product Delivery Timeframes (Customer)
        - Revenue Recognition (CEO)

#### Impact Analysis
- Determine a risk value (H, M, L)
- Risks can be minor or far-reaching
    - Fix doesn't actually fix anything
    - Fix breaks something else
    - Operating system failures
    - Data corruption
- What risks occur if you don't make the change
    - Security vulnerability
    - Application vulnerability
    - Unexpected downtime to other services

#### Test Results
- Sandbox testing environment
    - No connection to the real world or production system
    - A technological safe space
- Use a sandbox before making a change to production
    - Try the upgrade, apply the patch
    - Test and confirm before deployment
- Confirm the backout plan
    - Move everything back to the original
    - If something goes wrong in production, you can rollback

#### Backout Plan
- Many documented cases show that a minor change with no backout plans has brought down entire networks
- A way to revert changes to original configuration
- Isn't as easy as it sounds as some changes are very difficult to revert
- Always have good backups
- Prepare for the worst, hope for the best

#### Maintenance Window
- Difficult part is finding time to implement the change
- Plan and consider before making changes
- Working hours may not be the best time to update
    - Off hours or maintenance hours are better
- Oftentimes IT people come in during weekends, holidays, or very early in the morning
    - Challenging for 24/7 environments
- Time of the year may be considered
    - Retail networks are frozen during holiday season
    - No changes are allowed because many people are shopping
    - Make changes after new year

#### Standard Operating Procedure
- Change management is critical
    - Affects everyone in the organization
- Process must be well documented
    - Should be available to everyone along with all standard processes and procedures
